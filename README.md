Got it 👍 I'll draft a nice **README.md** for your **To-Do List App** project based on your folder structure and features.

Here’s a complete **README.md** you can paste directly into your project:

---

# 📋 To-Do List App

A simple yet modern **To-Do List application** built with **React Native + Expo**.
This app allows you to create **multiple lists**, add **tasks** inside each list, mark them as completed, and persist data with **AsyncStorage** so your tasks remain even after restarting the app.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Create and manage **multiple lists** (e.g., Work, Shopping, School).
* 📝 Add, edit, and delete tasks in each list.
* 🔄 Toggle tasks between **completed** and **incomplete**.
* 🧹 Clear all completed tasks with one click.
* 💾 **Persistent storage** with AsyncStorage (tasks are saved locally).
* 🎨 Modern & sleek UI with custom colors and icons.
* 📱 Works on **iOS, Android, and Web** (via Expo).
